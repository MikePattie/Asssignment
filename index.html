						<p> Welcome to my website!
							Born in the UK i've been living in Australia for 7 years now and i love life here down under. 
							Im a trained electrician and have worked on construction sites my whole life up until now when ive wanted to make a career change.
							I love to build PCs wether that be for myself or friends and i get huge satisfaction out of fixing any sort of problems people may run into with their machines! </p>

							<div class="sectionContent">
								
								
								
									<p> My personal interest with IT stemmed from two main things, when i was a child and my Dad bought our first family computer, i was instantly obsessed.
										I dabbled into the world of gaming from a young age and i remember thinking it seems impossible that somebody can create such a beautiful digital
										landscape with which i can interact with. <br> The next big point of my interest was when i realised that i was good at problem solving and seemed to be 
										able to research and fix problems with our PC at home, eventuallly i was going to school and troubleshooting friends issues with their PCs or phones and
									it was all with information that i self taught myself on the internet!! </p>
									
									<p> I chose to come to RMIT to further consolidate my knowledge within the field and learn an anbundance of new things! For whatever reason my proffesional life 
										turned out differently to how i expected and veered away from the path of IT. The recent pandemic was maybe a blessing in disguise for me as i was able to focus on
										what i really wanted to do with my life and thus i decided to go for it and enroll into the course. Im lucky to enough to have found a job as an IT support analyst
									and i belive this course is goiong to give me a better understandinhg to do my job more efficiently and vice-versa! </p>
									
									<p> During my studies i expect to learn a broad range of IT subjects. The reason i chose to go down the degree route instead of certifications is the sheer range of topics 
										that can be covered. I hope that by the end of it all i have really narrowed down the specific areas that hold my interest the most, its always better to learn stuff that you 
									enjoy! </p>

										<p> The position of a Cloud Engineer is someone who can analyse the partifular IT infrastructure needs of a company and implement a functioning cloud platform that is both sustainable and scalable. The number of different tools 
											you are able to use is substantial, this appeals to me personally as i know that theres a huge list of required skills that you need to have to put this into practice, also it seems to me that most companies in the future are
											moving towards cloud based infrastructure and the skills will be in high demand! 
											The majority of cloud Engineers are working from home espicially after the pandemic, i really like the idea of the felixble hours and feel as though personally I will thrive if i work in a comfortable familiar enviroment with no distractions.
											The most obvious skills required to excell in a role like this would be certification in the 3 major cloud providers;
										</p>
										
										<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Aws</a> <br>
										<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure</a> <br> <a href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Cloud</a> <br> <br> Knowledge in these 3 providers will put you in a 
										great position to become an in-demand cloud engineer but thats not all! You will also need skills in coding, to build your own and alter exisitng code (it seems to vary what particular code languages are demanded), automation is going to be an imporant factor in your platform. You need to be able to work within a team and you 
										should have an understanding of the companies needs. Over the next few years whilst gaining valuable experience in my IT suppport role i plan to work alongside my infrastructure team when possible and hopefully gain the skills required 
										to join their team. I'm very interested in learning about the existing scripts that automate the initial account setup we use when we create a new user at my workplace, also how to setup the Virtual Machines and servers that we use on a daily basis, i think
									skills like this will be transferrable into a proffession of cloud computing. </p>

										<p> There are a number of tests we can take that will show potential employers speicifc information about your personality type, below are some results of some of these tests for me personally.</P>
										
										<h3><i>Myers-Briggs</i> </h3>
										<br>
										<img src="myers-briggs.png" alt="myers-briggs" style="width:440px;height:300px">
										<br>
										
										<h3><i>Learning Styles test</i></h3>
										<br>
										<img src="pie-1.png" alt="learning-styles" style="width:340px;hieght:00px"> <img src="pie-2.png" alt="learning-styles" style="width:440px;height:285px">
										<br>
										<h3><i>Creativity test</i></h3>
										<br>
										<img src="create.png" alt="creativity-test" style="width:540px;height:80px">
										
										<p> The results of these tests tell me that i am a very practical learner, that i like to make my own bold decisions
											and put them into practice in ways that others wouldnt think of. This means i can be dismissive of other peoples
											ideas if i belive them to be arbitary and i feel like there could be better uses of my time elsewhere. <p>
												
												<p> Anytime people work within a group with different personalities those people are likely to clash. Looking at my
													results i see a possible conflict occuring mainly due to my perception of what a rational and pracitcal idea may be compared
													to somebody else, i may like to push boundaries with regards to new ideas that others may not be comfortable with and be 
												insenstivie to any negative feelings towards this. </P>
												
												<p>When Forming a team i will take into account the positive and negatvie aspects of my personality tests and should conflict occur
													i will take the following steps to mitigate any clashing; i will listen carefully and consider other peoples ideas, try to see others 
													ideas from a different persepective in a patient manner, maintain pace with others should we be working at a different speeds and if i 
												wish to discover some new things/ideas that people may not be familiar with, i will show respect for the rules and only pursue ideas within the scope of the task. </p>

										<div class="sectionTitle"><h1> My Project </h1><br></div>
										<div class="sectionContent">
											<article>
												<h3><i> The idea </i></h3>
												
												<p>There is a Large number of independent breweries in New South Wales, as of 2020 the most of any state Australia-wide with 99  (Statista Nov. 2020). It seems to be
													a bit of a gamble as to what particular brews you will get at any given brewery on any given day, there are a lot of special one-offs that you may miss out on an
													opportunity to taste if you’re not aware of when they are on sale. My vision is to create a mobile phone application that will help customers plan ahead, think of it like a brewery catalogue, users will be able to create accounts and upload 
												information themselves to a database that can then be viewed by other users to determine what the breweries have in stock at that particular time, also any events or dining options they have also. </P>
												
												<h3><i>Features</i> </h3>
												
												<p> I would like to implement a map style feature that is going to use GPS technology to gather the information on your location and pin surrounding venues to give the user a clean and easy way to
												see where they are in relation to said venues, the app must be easy to use!! A search bar is to be included also if you would like to search for a specific favorite brewery or a favorite beer.</P> 
												
												<p> A rating system is a must, users should be able to see clearly which beers or which breweries other users enjoyed too, and then recommendations can be given when the ratings you’ve given personally can be
													compared to other users who have enjoyed similar things. A 0-5 star rating attached to each product and venue is how I wish to achieve this, and also a section where a user can write a comment further explaining why they
												have chosen to give the rating they did. There is also to be an events page, a digital calendar where any upcoming events/special brews can be added into.  </p>
												
												<p> Push notifications are another feature to be included, if people are looking for a specific thing they need to be made aware of when this is available to them as soon as possible. For example if they have
													visited a brewery before and given a high rating they will be notified of any events that are happening at that brewery from the information stored in the events calendar. The same thing applies
												if they liked a particular beer, they can see what brewerys offer the same or similar products. </p>
												
												<p> The user interface is another area of paramount importance, I know that personally I have straight away deleted apps when they look ugly. To achieve this I will use clean, bright and bold colours whilst
													also utilizing big buttons to help guide the user through menus in a way that they can clearly understand what to do and which buttons to press. With the amount of different smartphones on the market currently, the app
													also needs to be adaptable to different screen sizes. Though its an intention of mine to make this app very easy to use to the point where anyone can pick up how to use it quickly, I will also include a how-to page with
												basic information on how the application works and how to get the most out of all the features.  </P>
												
												<p> I want to understand my users experiences within the app, I will achieve this with a simple feedback system which will be a text box in which you can report a bug, give ideas on new features or just give general feedback whether it be positive or negative. </p>
												
												<h3><i> Tools and Development </i></h3>
												
												<p> I intend to use an open source software. As stated before i want to develop a clean looking application that is supported on multiple platforms, some open source tools that i can use to create 
													all the features i need include: <br>
													<br> <a href="https://buildfire.com/developers/" target="_blank">Buildfire</a> <br> <a href="https://framework7.io/" target="_blank">Framework 7</a> <br>
													<a href="https://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank">Ionic</a> <br><br>
													Within the app users will mainly need to search for stored information, recive push notifications and collect statistical data about other users. Aws amplify
													is a standout cloud based platform that is going to meet all the requirements of my app through it's Library component, here i can store information, collect analytics, send push notifications and 
													add multiple other features to my app on the backend. Being a cloud-based service its also scalable which is going to become important should the app be succesfull, more information can be found on their wesbtie 
													<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amplify" target="_blank"><i>Aws Amplify</i></a> <br>
													
													<h3><i> Skills </i></h3>
													
													<p> In order for the App to be sucessful i will need to possess or outsource various skills. Cloud infrastructure is going to be such an important part of my development, its a necessity 
														that within my team there is a good undertsanding of this technology (in my case AWS cloud services). Modern coding languages are also required, in my case HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
														These expertise are around in abundance and i believe it to be feasible to obtain these skills should i not possses them myself.
														One of the main moving parts is going to be the database, I will need skilled data engineers to design a database that allows my app to run smoothly.
														
														<h3><i>Overview</i></h3>
														
														<p> If the project is successful I believe that I would have created a helpful tool to those people that may not have a lot of leisure time and want to ensure that they are going to have an enjoyable
															experience without wasting any of their time. My goal isn’t to sell, or to make money and isn't intended to solve a problem as such, it is simply an idea to bring users a more specified
														experience within a particular hobby that aligns with my own. Having said that, i would absolutely entertain the possibbilty of enough growth to bring my service to a wider audience.  </p>
